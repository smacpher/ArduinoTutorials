/* 
 This sketch takes advantage of arduino's Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).
 Analog pins A0-A5 can report back a value between 0-1023, which maps to a range from 0 to 5 volts.
 Uses a temperature sensor which outputs a changing voltage depending on the temperature it senses
 This sensor has three pins -- one that connects to ground, another that connects to power, and 
 another one that outputs the variable voltage to arduino.  There are several different models
 of temperature sensors; we are using a TMP36 which outputs voltage directly proportional to
 the temperature it senses in Celsius.
 A baud rate (commonly set as 9600 for a serial port) is essentially the bits per second configuration.  A 'baud' 
 can represent any amount of bits.  For example, if a baud represents 1 bit, and the baud rate is 9600 bauds/second, then
 our media is capable of sending up to 9600 bits per second.
